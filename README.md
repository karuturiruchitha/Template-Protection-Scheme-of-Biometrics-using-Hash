Multimodal biometric authentication systems were proven to be efficient and given better security and accuracy in many online transaction systems and applications when compared to conventional security procedures. Multimodal biometrics were applied to various authentication and recognition services where high security is a major concern. But keeping the privacy of enrolled subjects is the biggest challenge for biometric security researchers. To solve the challenges in privacy preservations of enrolled subjects, numerous template privacy protection schemes were proposed. Features generated from the Multimodal biometrics samples were protected by converting them into an unintelligible format using encryption techniques so that hackers were not able to compromise the Multimodal biometrics template easily. This way of protecting the enrolled subjects was called a template protection scheme.
1.2	OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
	This template protection is an important factor because there are many hazards of identity theft and privacyleak issues, which are enrolled in databases secured by biometric credentials and raise privacy concerns. The goal is to increase the Exhaustive search and employ biometrics in a way that protects privacy while maximizing user control, minimizing the possibility of abuse, and ensuring the flawless operation of systems that use biometrics. A person's facial image should not be stored in a database directly. Biometric recognition using biometric encryption uses features like face, finger print, finger vein to encrypt (code) extra data just the biometrically encrypted data is kept, not any other information, such as a cryptographic key. But due to the rapid growth in attacking knowledge among the adversaries, simple encryption techniques were not sufficient to give complete security protecting the templates.
As a result of the advancement of the Internet and Artificial Intelligence technology, in many application domains, the method based on biometric identification verification is displacing the conventional password-based access control and identity authentication technology. For Internet applications, secure identity identification is crucial. The widely used Biometric technique isnothing but Multimodal Biometric recognition. Particularly, it seems that facial recognition technologies have grown in popularity and are being used for entry and border control, as well as monitoring public locations.
	In past years it might seem that there were many issues raised about personal information leaks and Hacking. The corruption of data is a global issue. The data in the database is not always safe. Various biometric template protection schemes were already proposed using face, Finger Prints, Iris. To protect that data, we should perform some Privacy preserving Techniques. This is because our data like bank information, personal documents, Health monitoring data whatever maybe should provide security Schemes .Various biometric template protection schemes were already proposed using face. Some of the methods applied CNN, entropy, and hashing for template protection in some cases those systems failed in indexing and Time computation issues. The recognition efficiency was quite the same for every proposed method but lag in Exhaustive Search Efficiency. Unfortunately, it was observed from the literature that the approaches proposed were not supporting indexing, which would provide increased exhaustive search efficiency and reduced computation complexity in various template protection schemes. Also, it is identified from the results of those schemes that the hash-based indexing methods were given better performance when compared to conventional approaches, especially privacy-preserving face identification systems that use a hashing look-up table to index and retrieve protected face templates. Additionally, this paper is intended to analyze the high level of privacy protection for the enrolled subjects which was ensured by the homomorphic encryption algorithms used to safeguard these Multimodal Biometric templates and summarizes various template protection schemes, encryption algorithms used to protect the templates, and concealment techniques.
Here the analyzed the security enhancements and exhaustive search capability of the methods proposed in the current context and it is identified that indexing will reduce the time complexity and enhance the exhaustive search. 
The rest of this paper's chapters were organized with background study, related work,and discussions.

1.3	BACKGROUND STUDY OF TEMPLATE PROTECTION
	Template Protection Scheme (TPS) is a security mechanism used to safeguard the personal information of an individual in biometric systems. It involves generating a template (a mathematical representation of biometric data) that is protected by encryption and other security measures. This template is used to verify the identity of an individual during subsequent biometric authentication.
One approach to implementing TPS for multimodal biometrics is through the use of hash generation. In this method, the biometric data is hashed (converted into a fixed-length string of characters) using a cryptographic hash function. The resulting hash value is then used to create the template.
To ensure the security of the template, a secret key is used to encrypt the hash value before storingit. The encrypted hash value can only be decrypted using the secret key, which is kept secure andknown only to authorized parties. During authentication, the biometric data is hashed using the same cryptographic hash function, and the resulting hash value is encrypted using the secret key. The encrypted hash value is then compared to the encrypted hash value stored in the template. If the two values match, the individual is authenticated.
This approach to TPS provides a high level of security for multimodal biometric systems, as the original biometric data is never stored and the template is protected by encryption and a secret key.It also allows for efficient storage and processing of biometric data, as the fixed-length hash value is much smaller than the original data.
Overall, the use of hash generation in TPS is a promising approach to securing multimodal biometric systems and protecting the personal information of individuals. However, it is important to ensure that appropriate cryptographic techniques are used to prevent attacks such as collision attacks and rainbow table attacks.
Then these images were selected for training, testing, and assessing the effectiveness of machinelearning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, also known as common vision algorithms,which are included in an image dataset. Features were extracted by some feature- extracting methods like CNN, Vector, etc. Now the features get Embedded were converted into unintelligible format, which means a method of encryption. By using a secret key, picture encryption transforms a plain image into an encrypted one. CNN is used as the following step in the data acquisition process. Layers of a deep convolutional neural network. Convolutional and pooling layers are usually switched back and forth. Convolutional neural networks with deep learning.
1.2.1 	Methods for Template Protection
	There are several methods that can be used for template protection scheme (TPS) to safeguard biometric data. Some of these methods are:
	Cryptographic Hashing: This is a widely used method for TPS in which biometric data is hashed (converted into a fixed-length string of characters) using a cryptographic hash function. The resulting hash value is then used to create the template. To ensure the security of the template, a secret key is used to encrypt the hash value before storing it.
	Fuzzy Extractors: Fuzzy extractors are another commonly used method for TPS that involves generating a secret key from biometric data. This secret key is used to encrypt the template, which can only be decrypted using the same key. Fuzzy extractors can handle noisy biometric data by extracting a stable and consistent key from multiple noisy biometric inputs.
	Cancelable Biometrics: This method involves transforming the original biometric data into a new,cancelable form that cannot be reverse-engineered to recover the original biometric information. This transformed data is used to generate the template, which is protected by encryption and other security measures.
	Random Projections: In this method, the original biometric data is projected onto a random subspace, and the resulting projection is used to create the template. The projection process is designed to be reversible, allowing the original biometric data to be recovered if necessary.
	Biometric Encryption: This method involves encrypting the original biometric data using a public key encryption scheme. The encrypted data is used to generate the template, which is stored in encrypted form. The decryption key is kept secret and is used to decrypt the template during authentication. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method will depend on the specific requirements of the biometric system and the level of security needed.
1.3.1	Steps to protect the template
Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into a set of meaningful and informative features that can be used for analysis or modeling. In many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, feature extraction is a critical step in building machine learning models.
	Cryptographic Hashing: This is a widely used method for TPS in which biometric data is hashed (converted into a fixed-length string of characters) using a cryptographic hash function. The resulting hash value is then used to create the template. To ensure the security of the template, a secret key is used to encrypt the hash value before storing it
	Fuzzy Extractors: Fuzzy extractors are another commonly used method for TPS that involves generating asecret key from biometric data. This secret key is used to encrypt the template, which can only be decrypted using the same key. Fuzzy extractors can handle noisy biometric data by extracting a stable and consistent key from multiple noisy biometric inputs.
	Cancelable Biometrics: This method involves transforming the original biometric data into a new, cancelable form that cannot be reverse-engineered to recover the original biometric information. This transformed data is used to generate the template, which is protected by encryption and other security measures.
	Random Projections: In this method, the original biometric data is projected onto a random subspace, and the resulting projection is used to create the template. The projection process is designed to be reversible, allowing the original biometric data to be recovered if necessary.
	Biometric Encryption: This method involves encrypting the original biometric data using a public key encryption scheme. The encrypted data is used to generate the template, which is stored in encrypted form. The decryption key is kept secret and is used to decrypt the template during authentication.
	Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method will depend on thespecific requirements of the biometric system and the level of security needed, vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, feature extraction is a critical step in building machine learning models.
	The goal of feature extraction is to extract the most relevant and informative features from raw data while reducing the dimensionality of the data. This is done by identifying patterns and relationships in the data and transforming them into a set of features that can be easily processed by a machine learning algorithm.
	In computer vision, for example, feature extraction is often used to extract features such as edges, corners, and textures from images. These features can be used to recognize objects, classify images, or perform other tasks. In speech recognition, features such as the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted from audio signals to represent the spectral characteristics of Speech sounds.
	Homomorphic encryption: Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertext, without the need to decrypt the data first. This means that data can remain encrypted throughout the entirecomputation process, preserving privacy and security.
In traditional encryption schemes, data is encrypted before transmission to prevent unauthorized access, but it must be decrypted before it can be processed. Homomorphic encryption, on the other hand, allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, without requiring decryption.
There are two main types of homomorphic encryption:
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): FHE is the most general type of homomorphic encryption and allows any computation to be performed on encrypted data, including complex algorithms such as machine Learning and artificial intelligence. However, FHE is computationally intensive and is not yet practical for most applications. Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE):
PHE allows only certain types of computations to be performed on encrypted data, such as addition or multiplication. PHE is more practical than FHE and has been used in several applications, such as secure computation of financial data.
Homomorphic encryption has several advantages, including:
Privacy: Homomorphic encryption allows data to remain encrypted throughout the entire computation process, providing strong privacy guarantees.
Security: Homomorphic encryption protects against attacks that exploit weaknesses in the decryption process.
Efficiency: While FHE is still computationally intensive, PHE can be more efficient than other secure computation methods.
Homomorphic encryption is an active area of research, and while it is not yet widely used in practice, it has the potential to revolutionize the way sensitive data is processed and analyzed.
Hash key generation: Hash key generation is the process of generating a fixed-length, unique string of characters from a given input data. Hash keys are commonly used in cryptography, digital signatures, and password storage, amongother applications. The process of generating hash keys is typically done using a hash function. A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input message of arbitrary length and generates a fixed- length output, called a hash value or message digest. The output is usually a string of hexadecimal digits that serves as a unique identifier for the input data.
The key characteristics of a good hash function include:
Deterministic: A hash function should produce the same hash value for the same input every time it is run.
Uniformity: A good hash function should produce uniformly distributed hash values, with no bias towardsany particular input.
Non-invertibility: It should be computationally infeasible to reconstruct the original input data from the hash value.
Collision resistance: A good hash function should produce different hash values for different inputs, and should make it difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.
There are many hash functions available, including MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. The choice of hash function will depend on the specific application and the level of security required.
Matching rate: Matching rate refers to the accuracy or success rate of a biometric authentication system in matching a given biometric sample (such as a fingerprint, face image, or voice recording) to a
stored template or database of biometric templates. The matching rate is typically expressed as a percentage or a ratio of the number of successful matches to the total number of comparison attempts. For example, if a system successfully matches 90 out of 100 attempts, the matching rate would be 90%.
The matching rate of a biometric authentication system depends on several factors, including: Quality of the biometric sample: The quality of the biometric sample used for comparison affects the matching rate. If the sample is noisy or of poor quality, the system may not be able to accurately match it to the stored template.
Size and diversity of the biometric database: The size and diversity of the biometric database can affect the matching rate. A larger and more diverse database may improve the system's ability to match a wider range of biometric samples.
Type of biometric technology: Different biometric technologies have different matching rates. For example, iris recognition and facial recognition are generally considered more accurate than fingerprint recognition.
Threshold setting: The threshold setting for the system determines the level of similarity required for a match to be considered successful. A higher threshold may result in a lower matching rate but a higher level of security.
The matching rate is an important metric for evaluating the performance of a biometric authentication system. High matching rates are important for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the system, while low matching rates can lead to false positives or false negatives, which can compromise security.
1.3.2	Applications of Template Protection Scheme

TPS can help to protect the privacy and security of biometric templates used in these systems.Overall, TPS can be applied in a wide range of biometric authentication systems to protect the privacy and security of biometric templates. They play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of biometric authentication systems while maintaining the privacy and security of sensitive data.
1.4	PROBLEM STATEMENT

The biometric data must be collected according to established standards and protocols to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Biometric feature extraction: The next step is to extract the relevant features from the biometric data that will be used for authentication. This involves identifying unique patterns and characteristics in the biometric data that can be used to distinguish one user from another.
Template creation and storage: Once the biometric features are extracted, a biometric template is created for each user. The template is a mathematical representation of the user's biometric data that can be stored in a secure database for future use.

Evaluation and optimization: The TPS algorithm is evaluated and optimized to ensure that it meets the desired performance metrics, such as accuracy, efficiency, and security. The algorithm may be tested on a large dataset of biometric templates and samples to assess its performance and identify areas for improvement.
Integration and deployment: Once the TPS algorithm is optimized, it can be integrated into the biometric authentication system and deployed for use in real-world applications. The TPS algorithm should be designed to ensure interoperability and scalability, allowing it to be used in awide range of applications and contexts.
Overall, the proposed methodology for TPS involves a series of steps, from biometric data acquisition to authentication, aimed at protecting biometric templates while maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the authentication system.
